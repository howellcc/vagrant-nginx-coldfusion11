======= NEXT STEPS==========
Problems:
	-Current status of nginx rewrite:
		Working: /Mura_multisite/_donordrive_v2/features/
		Not Working: /Mura_multisite/_donordrive_v2/
		Not Working: /Mura_multisite/admin/

	-I tried to get some remote monitoring stuff working 2 ways:
	1. JStatd.
		Wrote /opt/jstatd.policy
			grant codebase "file:/opt/jdk/lib/tools.jar" { permission java.security.AllPermission; };
		jstatd -J-Djava.security.policy=/opt/jstatd.policy -p 1099
		http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstatd.html
		http://www.nljug.org/nieuws/blog-profiling-remote-jvm-using-visualvm/
		Visual VM couldn't get passed the fact that I was trying to reference a VM instead of the host machine.
	2. JMX remote
		Tried adding the following to the jvm.config
			-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9010 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=172.20.0.15
		Seemed like it should work but VisualVM still couldn't see it.

	-Consider mounting shared folders via nfs as its MUCH FASTER

===========================================
Files Destinations and Purposes
===========================================
/cf11/
	coldfusion -> /opt/coldfusion11/cfusion/bin/ - CF init script
	hotfix_007.jar -> /opt/coldfusion11/cfusion/hf-updates/ - latest CF hotfix
	server.xml -> /opt/coldfusion11/cfusion/runtime/conf/ - tomcat server.xml file

/nginx/
	/sites-available/
		default ->/etc/nginx/sites-available/ - default site declaration
	cfProxy.conf -> /etc/nginx/ - NGINX proxy config for passing requests for cf files to CF
	nginx.conf -> /etc/nginx/
	proxy_params -> /etc/nginx/ - not sure if this is sill being used.

bashrcAdditions.sh - just a few additions I like to have added to my .bashrc file.
bootstrap.sh - This is the configuration workhorse. It does all the things.
CFSilentInstall.properties - Properties file so that the CF Installer knows what to do.
GC-startup -> /etc/init.d/ - This is an init script that resets a few things that are different between a vbox machine start and "vagrant up".  Notably shared folders.
Vagrantfile - Vagrant config file.



============================================
Dependencies - git LFS (large file support)
============================================
CF11 installer
CF11 hotfix (currently hf7)
java 8 (currently jdk-8u65)
Fonts for PDFg http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/font/ibm-type1/snapshot/font-ibm-type1-1.0.3.tar.gz

==================================
Things learned along the way
==================================
- One performance improvement I read about along the way was switching from a shared folder to an NFS mounted file. This is a NO GO. NFS on windows introduced case sensitivity realative to file names. This caused a lot of "missing files" on the Mura side of things.
